My entry for Seven Day Roguelike (7DRL) Challenge 2017

## Vic and Jammie
In 1991, two aliens [ToeJam and Earl] from the planet Funkotron
crash landed on the most insane planet in the galaxy, Planet Earth!

After a grueling journey through 25 levels, ToeJam and Earl reassembled
their Righteous Rapmaster Rocketship and returned to their families on
Funkotron.

Twenty six years later, ToeJam's daughter Jammie passed her driver's
test. Her best friend Vic (Earl's daughter Victoria) convinced her
to take the Righteous Rapmaster Rocketship for a joyride.

Certain that their Dads had exaggerated their difficulty on Earth, they
decided to fly around Earth to see for themselves.

However, Jammie was a new driver and had a slight, mishap, trying to
get into standard orbit. She and Vic crashed to the planet below.
Like their dads, the 10 pieces of the Righteous Rapmaster Rocketship
are scattered on Earth. All they have to do is avoid the earthlings,
reassemble the rocketship, and fly home to Funkotron.

How hard could it be?
